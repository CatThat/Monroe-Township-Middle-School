                <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">Monroe Township is named after James Monroe.</h5>
                <p class="text-muted text-left">Monroe Township is a sprawling, suburban/semi-rural community in the southernmost part of Middlesex County, NJ. Its significant demographic characteristic is the presence of two large distinct populations: young families with pre-school and school age children, and older adults, most of whom live in the ten pre-retirement and retirement communities located in the Township. Approximately 15,000 of the Townshipâ€™s 39,132 residents live in these adult communities. A large majority of them are over 60 years of age and most moved to Monroe from the Greater Metropolitan New York Area following retirement.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">A swimming pool, swimming bath, wading pool, paddling pool, or simply pool, is a structure designed to hold water to enable swimming or other leisure activities. Pools can be built into the ground (in-ground pools) or built above ground (as a freestanding construction or as part of a building or other larger structure), and may be found as a feature aboard ocean-liners and cruise ships. In-ground pools are most commonly constructed from materials such as concrete, natural stone, metal, plastic, or fiberglass, and can be of a custom size and shape or built to a standardized size, the largest of which is the Olympic-size swimming pool.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">A park is an area of natural, semi-natural or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats. Urban parks are green spaces set aside for recreation inside towns and cities. National parks and country parks are green spaces used for recreation in the countryside. State parks and provincial parks are administered by sub-national government states and agencies. Parks may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains or playground structures. Many parks have fields for playing sports such as baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball. Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills.</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Plan A removes the sixth grade class from the current Monroe Township Middle School and provides housing for 1,410 students.

                The proposed total cost of Plan B is $115.70 million. The proposed plan constructs an additional academic pod, or wing, at Brookside Elementary School; constructs a modular classroom addition at Barclay Brook Elementary, which adds six to eight classrooms; constructs an estimated 1,000-student area at Applegarth site to replace Applegarth School; removes the sixth grade from the current Monroe Township Middle School; and provides housing for 1,904 students.

                The proposed total cost for Plan C is $146.72 million. The plan is similar to Plan B, but also adds the construction of an 636-person elementary school at the site of the previous golf course along with replacing Applegarth School.

                Each plan calls for the redistricting of the elementary schools from kindergarten to fourth grade. Plan C calls for the redistricting of kindergarten to sixth grade.</p>
